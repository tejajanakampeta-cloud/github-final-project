# Simple Interest Calculator

This project explains a simple interest calculator that computes simple interest based on principal, rate of interest, and time.

## Formula

Simple Interest (SI) is calculated using the formula:

SI = (P × R × T) / 100

Where:
- P = Principal amount
- R = Rate of interest (per annum)
- T = Time (in years)

## Example

If:
- Principal = 1000
- Rate = 5%
- Time = 2 years

Then:
SI = (1000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = 100

## Usage

1. Enter the principal amount.
2. Enter the annual rate of interest.
3. Enter the time period in years.
4. Apply the formula to get the simple interest.
